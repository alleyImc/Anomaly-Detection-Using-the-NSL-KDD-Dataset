# Anomaly-Detection-Using-the-NSL-KDD-Dataset
The objective of this project is to develop an anomaly detection system that can automatically identify normal and abnormal (attack) states by analyzing network traffic data. The aim is to create an effective classifier by utilizing preprocessing, data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning models on the NSL-KDD dataset. This project seeks to contribute to the development of more effective and proactive threat detection methods for network security.
